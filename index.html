    <center><h1>Welcome to the Lewis University Survey</h1></center>
    <center><h2>Hello, My name is Angelo Goduto and I am the current Vice President of the Lewis
        University Student Senate. I am the voice for the students and I am here to have you
        fill out a simple survey about your time here at Lewis University. The questions should
        be simple to answer and will help me make this University a better place. The student
        voice is the most important because while you are at Lewis University, it should be
        all about you. You are here to finish your schooling, and we want to help make this the
        best place to learn.
    </h2></center>
